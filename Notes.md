# Final Project Idea: Crafter's Helper

The idea behind this final project is to create a web-based application where crafter's can add their own notes on different projects. The reason I am choosing this as the idea for my final project is because I know, from personal experience, that it is handy to have all notes in one place when you are experimenting with different ways of crafting something. For example, when working with resin, it is a great idea to make notes of what amounts of color, the type of colorant, the amount of glitters, the way you pour them in, the amount of resin used, etc. This way when you reach the desired result, you know how to recreate it next time.
